# joke-script
This is a python application that moves the mouse cursor around, flashes the screen and plays a song. Drop into a users startup folder to prank unsuspecting users who dont lock their devices!

# Instructions
1. Put the python script and the MP3 (or another of your choice) in the same directory
2. Run on the command line with: python joke.py

For best effect
1. Convert the python script into an executable with something like autopytoexe
2. Then place the exe in the same directory as the MP3 (or another of your choice)
3. Create a shortcut of the exe and place in the users startup directory

Make sure that pyautogui and pygame are installed with pip in your python enterpreter
